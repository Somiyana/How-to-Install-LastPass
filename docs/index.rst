What is LastPass?

Before diving into the installation process, it’s essential to understand what LastPass is and why it is widely trusted by millions of users worldwide.

LastPass is a password manager that helps users securely store and manage passwords, secure notes, and other sensitive information.

The ability to store multiple passwords and log in to accounts automatically means that you won’t have to struggle to remember a long list of complex passwords. LastPass also has security features such as two-factor authentication (2FA), which further protects your account from unauthorized access.
